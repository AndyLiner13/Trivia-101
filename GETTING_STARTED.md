   - Copy the entire file content  
   - Attach to a separate CustomUI Gizmo

#### Manager Scripts (Recommended)
For full functionality, also upload these:

3. **PlayerManager.ts** - Enhanced player management
4. **PhoneManager.ts** - Phone UI coordination
5. **TriviaAssetManager.ts** - Asset loading optimization
6. **TriviaGameStateManager.ts** - Game state synchronization
7. **TriviaScoreManager.ts** - Advanced scoring
8. **TriviaTimeoutManager.ts** - Timer management

#### Supporting Files
9. **TriviaNetworkEvents.ts** - Network event definitions
10. **TriviaPlayerUtils.ts** - Utility functions

### 3. Asset Configuration

The game uses various assets that you'll need to configure:

#### Required Assets
1. **Question Images** - For image-based questions
2. **UI Backgrounds** - Interface styling
3. **Icons and Buttons** - UI elements
4. **Sound Effects** - Audio feedback

#### Setting Up Assets
1. Upload your assets to Horizon Worlds
2. Copy the Asset IDs from the Asset Library
3. Update the asset references in the `Asset IDs/` folder files
4. Modify the asset constants in your scripts

**Example asset configuration:**
```typescript
// In your script, update these with your actual Asset IDs
const BACKGROUND_ASSET_ID = "your-background-asset-id-here";
const ICON_ASSET_ID = "your-icon-asset-id-here";
```

### 4. Question Database Setup

#### Using Included Questions
The project comes with thousands of pre-made questions:
- General Knowledge (3,000 questions)
- Entertainment categories (Film, Music, TV, Games)
- Geography, History, Science & Nature
- Special Italian Brainrot Quiz with images

#### Adding Custom Questions
1. Open any file in `TriviaQuestions/`
2. Follow this JSON format:
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Your question text here?",
      "answers": ["Correct Answer", "Wrong Answer 1", "Wrong Answer 2", "Wrong Answer 3"],
      "category": "Your Category",
      "difficulty": "easy"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Loading Questions in Game
Questions are loaded dynamically based on the selected category. The game will automatically find and use your question files.

### 5. Game Configuration

#### Default Settings
The game starts with these default settings:
- **Time Limit:** 30 seconds per question
- **Questions per Game:** 20 questions
- **Default Category:** Italian Brainrot Quiz
- **Auto-advance:** Enabled

#### Customizing Settings
Modify these in the `TriviaGame.ts` file:
```typescript
private gameConfigBinding = new Binding({
  timeLimit: 45,        // Seconds per question
  autoAdvance: true,    // Auto-advance after all players answer
  numQuestions: 15,     // Questions per game
  category: "General Knowledge",  // Default category
  difficulty: "medium"  // Default difficulty
});
```

### 6. Network Setup

The game uses Horizon Worlds' network events for multiplayer functionality:

#### Host Authority
- One player becomes the "host" (usually the first to start)
- Host controls game flow and question progression
- All players receive updates from the host

#### Player Synchronization
- Player answers are synchronized in real-time
- Scores update live during gameplay
- Players can join/leave mid-game
